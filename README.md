# I WANNA LEARN RUST

This project is a progression for learning the rust programming language.

Read [the installation guide](INSTALL.md) to prepare your machine. This repo is organized as a WORKSPACE, with each subdirectory being its own create (project) with a /src/main.rs that you can run with `cargo run`, example `cargo run --bin hello-world`.
